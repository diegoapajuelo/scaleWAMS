**WAMS Scale Solution**
=========================================

This project aims to demonstrate how we can move away from absolute (x, y) positioning to relative positioning in WAMS applications.

You will need to install WAMS first: [WAMS GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hcilab/wams#installation)

Once all the dependencies have been installed, go run `app.js` to initiate the program.

Motive
-------------------------------------------

I read the paper in the ACM ([link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3593236)). Unfortunately, it is no longer available for free.

The video demonstrations illustrated a way to allow devices to interact with each other pseudo-physically via a shared canvas on a web server.

Reading through your paper, I recall reading about how your team wished to allow the canvas (done) and the objects on the canvas to scale with device size. I figured a simple solution by referencing the common practice in web development: Relative positioning.

That is, a positioning that is relative to everything else, in this case, the client's view.

It is a simple concept to grasp for developing programmers, staying true to the modus operandi of your project.

**About me**
-------------------------------------------

I'm a keen student looking to learn more about how humans interact with computers.

I've worked on optimizing the UX on websites, sales pages, etc. in the past, but have always wanted to know more about how the prebuilt tools I use worked (such as Clickfunnels, Figma, Notion). There's clearly room for improvement.

I graduated early at 17 this June 2023 (Applying to University 2024) and have been working on projects outside of my comfort zone, such as this.

To-do
-------------------------------------------
> Allow relative scaling of objects whilst maintaing appropriate aspect ratio.
